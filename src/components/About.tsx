      <p>
        My current role is “Cloud Native Engineer / Solutions Architect”. I get
        excited from new design patterns and believe in learning about the inner
        workings of the technology. I have fulfilled both dev-ops and software
        engineering roles, from blockchain, cloud native microservices,
        Kubernetes orchestration to iOS frontend. I tend to go vertical in terms
        of knowledge expansion. Diverse experiences allow for new connections
        which feed creativity. To come up with creative solutions I need a broad
        perspective on the problem. At my current project I’m responsible for
        architecting and implementing a cloud infrastructure, hosting a
        multi-organizational blockchain network. Think of Kubernetes, Terraform,
        Helm, Docker, Typescript, Hyperledger Fabric, Concourse CI. The thing
        that excites me the most here is the amount of unknowns. Deploying a
        distributed ledger with a distributed infrastructure orchestrator force
        you to learn the ins and outs of the technology and edge cases. My
        stickability towards quality and a sincere desire to things right have
        steered me towards natural leadership positions. After my bachelors I
        became project lead after 2 months as an app developer, managing 2 local
        and a remote developer team from Ukraine. At IBM, I was approached to
        become a mobile team lead after 3 months into the job. I get excited
        from being at a position where I can steer, design solutions while at
        the same time support juniors and hire new talents.
