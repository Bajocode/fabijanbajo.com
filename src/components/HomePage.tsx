          I build stuff, try to learn everything I can, connecting the dots across various domains in the hope to solve a big problem soon (at a company or my own thingy, as long as I&apos;m part of something big with passionate people). Having fulfilled dev-ops and engineering roles, from migrating an on-premise e-com platform to the cloud, to consulting a blockchain team in Paris on cloud-native infrastructures and developing mobile apps myself, I tend to go vertical in terms of knowledge expansion. At the moment Iâ€™m a dev-ops engineer / solutions architect for an international blockchain project, but before this an engineering lead and full-stack mobile developer. I geek out on software architectures, patterns and infrastructure design, reading those nerdy Martin Fowler books etc.
